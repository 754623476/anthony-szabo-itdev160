                    <th>The Nintendo 3DS (2011) has the potential to be a massive stride forward from its predecessors and another landmark product that Nintendo can lay claim to.</th>
                    <th>The Nintendo 3DS XL was a great handheld in its day, but it's since been superseded by both the New Nintendo 3DS XL and the Nintendo Switch. That said, if you're looking for a budget handheld console and don't mind the slightly dated hardware, then 2012's 3DS XL is still a great choice.</th>
                    <th>Most of the New Nintendo 3DS's improvements were minor ones, but the second analogue stick and much-improved 3D feature made this the definitive 3DS. Now that the Nintendo Switch is available, you might wonder whether it's worth picking up this older piece of hardware from 2015. But with an impressive library of games and a budget price tag, the 3DS is well worth considering.</th>
